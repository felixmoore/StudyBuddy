# Study Buddy
A friendly Discord.js bot to help keep you accountable when studying. Also rewards you with cat pics if you meet your goals!

My HackNotts2020 project! Youtube demo [here](https://youtu.be/VpVuGiMp_q0) 

Illustration used as the bot's icon in my demo is from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/illustrations/illustration/ginger-cat-cat-is-reading).

Lots of help from https://discordjs.guide/ üíñ
Cat pics from https://aws.random.cat/meow üêà

If you want to use this in your own server, make yourself a bot & set up a `config.json` - there's an example in `example-config.json`!
You'll also need to install [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), if you're interested in the voice channel stuff.
